= Relm

Asynchronous, GTK+-based, GUI library, inspired by Elm, written in Rust.

*This library is in alpha stage: it has not been thoroughly tested and its API may change at any time.*

== Requirements

Since relm is based on GTK+, you need this library on your system in order to use it.

See http://gtk-rs.org/docs-src/requirements[this page] for information on how to install GTK+.

== Usage

First, add this to you `Cargo.toml`:

[source,bash]
----
gtk = "^0.1.2"
relm = "0.9.6"
relm-derive = "^0.9.2"
----

Next, add this to your crate:

[source,rust]
----
extern crate gtk;
#[macro_use]
extern crate relm;
#[macro_use]
extern crate relm_derive;

use relm::{Relm, Widget};
----

Then, create your model:

[source,rust]
----
struct Model {
    // …
}
----

The model contains the data related to a `Widget`. It may be updated by the `Widget::update` function.

Create your message `enum`:

[source,rust]
----
#[derive(Msg)]
enum Msg {
    // …
    Quit,
}
----

Messages are sent to `Widget::update` to indicate that an event happened. The model can be updated when an event is received.

Create a `struct` which represents a `Widget` which contains the GTK+ widgets (in this case, the main window of the application):

[source,rust]
----
struct Win {
    // …
    window: Window,
}
----

To make this `struct` a relm `Widget` that can be shown by the library, implement the `Widget` trait:

[source,rust]
----
impl Widget for Win {
    type Model = Model;
    type Msg = Msg;
    type Root = Window;

    // Return the initial model.
    fn model() -> Model {
        Model {
        }
    }

    // Return the root of this widget.
    fn root(&self) -> &Self::Root {
        &self.window
    }

    // The model may be updated when a message is received.
    // Widgets may also be updated in this function.
    // Futures and streams can be connected to send a message when a value is ready.
    fn update(&mut self, event: Msg, model: &mut Model) {
        match event {
             SomeEvent => {
                 let future = create_future();
                 relm.connect_exec_ignore_err(future, SomeEvent);
             },
            Quit => gtk::main_quit(),
        }
    }

    // Create the widgets.
    fn view(relm: Relm<Msg>, _model: &Self::Model) -> Self {
        // GTK+ widgets are used normally within a `Widget`.
        let window = Window::new(WindowType::Toplevel);
        // Connect the signal `delete_event` to send the `Quit` message.
        connect!(relm, window, connect_delete_event(_, _), return (Some(Quit), Inhibit(false)));
        // There is also a `connect!()` macro for GTK+ events that does not need a
        // value to be returned in the callback.
        window.show_all();
        Win {
            window: window,
        }
    }

    // The next method is optional.

    // Futures and streams can be connected when the `Widget` is created in the
    // `subscriptions()` method.
    // fn subscriptions(&mut self, relm: &Relm<Self>) {
    //     let stream = Interval::new(Duration::from_secs(1), relm.handle()).unwrap();
    //     relm.connect_exec_ignore_err(stream, Tick);
    // }
}
----

Finally, show this `Widget` by calling `relm::run()`:

[source,rust]
----
fn main() {
    relm::run::<Win>(()).unwrap();
}
----

=== `#[widget]` attribute

For the nightly users, a `#[widget]` attribute is provided to simplify the creation of a widget.

This attribute does the following:

 * Provide a `view!` macro to create the widget with a declarative syntax.
 * Automatically create the `fn container()`, `type Msg`, `type Model` and `type Root` items.
 * Automatically insert the call to `Widget::set_property()` in the `update()` function when assigning to an attribute of the model.
 * Automatically create the `Widget` `struct`.

To be able to use this attribute, you need to add the `relm-attributes` crate in your `Cargo.toml`:

[source,toml]
----
relm-attributes = "^0.9.0"
----

and to add the following code:

[source,rust]
----
#![feature(proc_macro)]

extern crate relm_attributes;

use relm_attributes::widget;
----

Here is an example using this attribute:

[source,rust]
----
#[widget]
impl Widget for Win {
    fn model() -> Model {
        Model {
            counter: 0,
        }
    }

    fn update(&mut self, event: Msg, model: &mut Model) {
        match event {
            // A call to self.label1.set_text() is automatically inserted by the
            // attribute every time the model.counter attribute is updated.
            Decrement => model.counter -= 1,
            Increment => model.counter += 1,
            Quit => gtk::main_quit(),
        }
    }

    view! {
        gtk::Window {
            gtk::Box {
                orientation: Vertical,
                gtk::Button {
                    // By default, an event with one paramater is assumed.
                    clicked => Increment,
                    // Hence, the previous line is equivalent to:
                    // clicked(_) => Increment,
                    label: "+",
                },
                gtk::Label {
                    // Bind the text property of this Label to the counter attribute
                    // of the model.
                    // Every time the counter attribute is updated, the text property
                    // will be updated too.
                    text: &model.counter.to_string(),
                },
                gtk::Button {
                    clicked => Decrement,
                    label: "-",
                },
            },
            // Use a tuple when you want to both send a message and return a value to
            // the GTK+ callback.
            delete_event(_, _) => (Quit, Inhibit(false)),
        }
    }
}
----

NOTE: The `struct Win` is now automatically created by the attribute, as are the function `container()` and the types `Model`, `Msg` and `Container`.
You can still provide the method and the types if needed, but you cannot create the `struct`.

WARNING: The `#[widget]` makes the generated `struct` public: hence, the corresponding model and message types must be public too.

[WARNING]
====
Your program might be slower when using this attribute because the code generation is simple.
For instance, the following code
[source,rust]
----
fn update(&mut self, event: Msg, model: &mut Model) {
    for _ in 0..100 {
        model.counter += 1;
    }
}
----
will generate this function:
[source,rust]
----
fn update(&mut self, event: Msg, model: &mut Model) {
    for _ in 0..100 {
        model.counter += 1;
        self.label1.set_text(&model.counter.to_string());
    }
}
----
====

[WARNING]
====
Also, the `set_property()` calls are currently only inserted when assigning to an attribute of the model.
For instance, the following code
[source,rust]
----
fn update(&mut self, event: Msg, model: &mut Model) {
    model.text.push_str("Text");
}
----
will not work as expected.

Please use the following variation if needed.
[source,rust]
----
fn update(&mut self, event: Msg, model: &mut Model) {
    model.text += "Text";
}
----
